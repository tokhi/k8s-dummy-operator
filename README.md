# Custom Kubernetes Controller

## Description
A simple Kubernetes custom controller using the operator SDK

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to get a local cluster for testing
### Pull the image
You can find the image in this repo: https://hub.docker.com/repositories/tokhiarh

### Running on the cluster
  Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

or trigger it manually:

```sh
 kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/dummy.interview.com_dummies.yaml
 ```

#### Creating the dummy Objects

Run the controller:

```sh
make run
```
and then:

```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/dummy_v1alpha1_dummy.yaml
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/dummy_v1alpha2_dummy.yaml
```

Get the pods:

```sh
 kubectl get pods
```

Describe the pod:

```sh
  kubectl describe po dummy-sample
```


Delete the pod manually

```sh
kubectl delete pod dummy-sample
```

Now exit and then `make run` again to let the controller recreate the deleted pod automatically.

To delete a dummy object
```sh
kubectl delete dummy dummy-sample
```
Now the controller will aslo delete the related pod.


 #### Deployment
 Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=tokhiarh/dummy-controller:v0.1.1
```
Apply the dummy sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/dummy_v1alpha1_dummy.yaml
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
